 *
 * - `--rm -i`: a fresh container per command, gone after it, standard input open
 * - `--network none`: no network unless asked
 * - `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`: no capabilities, no gaining them
 * - `--read-only` and a small `tmpfs` at `/tmp`: the image cannot be changed; only `/tmp` and the workspace are writable
 * - `--pids-limit`, `--memory`: a runaway command cannot take the machine
 * - `--user uid:gid` (Linux and macOS): files written in the workspace belong to the person, not root
 * - one bind mount, the workspace read-write; no Docker socket, no other folder, no host environment
 * - the command as base64 sourced by bash, so quotes and heredocs arrive exactly (see `sourceEncodedArgs`)
